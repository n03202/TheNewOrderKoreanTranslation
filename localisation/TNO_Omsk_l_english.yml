 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 POLITICS_DMITRY_KARBYSHEV_DESC:0 "드미트리 미하일로비치 카르비셰프의 이야기는 배신과 상실, 그리고 분노로 가득 찬 비극적인 이야기입니다. 처음에 그는 대전쟁 동안 차르를 위해 싸웠고, 내전기에는 적위군에 가담했으며, 조국이 다시 한번 침략당하자 군으로 돌아왔습니다. 독일군에게 포로로 잡혀 여러 포로 수용소를 전전한 카르비셰프는 얻어맞고 고문당했으며 죽기 직전까지 내버려졌지만, 절대로 인민에 대한 희망을 잃어버린 적이 없습니다. 마침내 그와 소수의 동료들은 죽음의 수용소를 탈출해 동부로 도망치는데 성공했고 나약한 연방이 장악한 지역을 지나쳐 라자리 카가노비치의 서시베리아 인민공화국에 가담했습니다.\n\n수년간 자신이 당했던 고통을 잊어버리지 않은 카르비셰프는 러시아가 다시는 그런 고통을 당하게 두지 않겠다고 굳게 다짐했습니다. 그는 자신이 §R대시련§! 이라고 이름붙인 러시아의 운명을 둔 독일과의 최후 결전을 준비하기 시작했습니다. 비슷한 사상을 가지고 대의에 동조한 수많은 동지들을 모은 그는 얼마 지나지 않아 카가노비치에게 대항해 반란을 일으켜 옴스크를 점거했고, 편안히 준비할 수 있도록 도시를 요새화했습니다. 카르비셰프는 자신이 러시아 앞에 벌어질 문제를 지도할 수 있는 유일한 단체라고 판단한 전 러시아 흑색 연합의 지배권을 주장했습니다.\n\n하지만 시간이 흘렀고 한때 충성스러웠던 장교들 사이에서 불신이 싹텄습니다. 이제 그는 아무 것도 할 수 없는 와중에 주변을 빙빙 도는 독수리들을 지켜보면서 자신이 구원하기를 바랬던 사람들이 적이 아닌 자기들끼리 싸우는 모습을 눈물 흘리며 바라볼 수 밖에 없게 되었습니다. 드미트리 카르비셰프는 §R대시련§!이 점차 가까워지는 와중에 자신의 유지를 이을 누군가가 나타나지 않는다면 러시아에 필연적으로 닥칠 파멸을 두려워하고 있습니다."
 
 POLITICS_DMITRY_YAZOV_DESC:0 "드미트리 티모페예비치 야조프는 소비에트 이후의 새로운 세대입니다: 레닌의 부상 이후로 태어났고, 차르와 대전쟁에 대한 기억은 없습니다. 아이일때 고난을 알았지만, 그러나 그것이 모국의 생존을 위한 불가결한 희생이란 것을 알았습니다. 나치들이 서쪽에서 몰려올때, 그들은 붉은 군대의 최전선에서 싸웠으며, 지상에 강림한 지옥을 보았으며 패배의 쓴잔을 들이켰고 또 들이켰습니다. 대조국전쟁이 끝났을떄, 그들의 전에 삶에 남아있던 행복도 승리한 독일인들한테 빼앗겼습니다. 1950년대의 서러시아 혁명전선의 군사적 실패와 그 이후의 몰락은 야조프같은 사람들이 더욱더 사고를 고정적으로 만들었습니다: 옛 소비에트 사령관들은 열정은 있었지만, 지도부는 필사적으로 신인이 필요했습니다. 어린 사람, 견고한 사람, 희생의 가치를 배웠고 직접 목격한 사람 말이죠.\n\n카르비셰프 동무가 그의 이상을 보기전에 쓰러지자, 그 짐은 이제 그의 제자였던 드미트리 야조프에게 떨어지게 되었습니다. 그의 전 스승과 다르게, 야조프는 실행하려는 의지와 체력이 있고, 그리고 이미 전국가를 전세계가 이제까지 경험해보지 못한 총력전을 준비할수 있는 형태로 변화시키고 있습니다. 그는 그의 인민들이 독일의 위협에 대한 복수를 위해 그들의 목숨을 포함한 모든것을 희생하길 예상하며, 그리고 많은 사람들이 그렇게 하길 원하고 있습니다. 아무것도, 심지어 핵무기의 불길로도, 그의 의지를 단념시키진 못할 것이며, 그리고 그는 자주 모든 독일인이 죽고 또 한 명 빼고 모든 러시아인이 죽어도, 승리가 될 것이라고 말합니다.\n\n옴스크가 잠에서 깨어나고 있고, 세계는 생각만으로도 두려워합니다."
 
 POLITICS_OMSK_COLLAPSED_AUTHORITY_DESC:0 "트미트리 야조프는 죽었습니다. 흑색연합의 챔피언이자, 카르비셰프의 위대한 임무를 짊어진 사람은 더 이상 없습니다. 러시아에서 가장 성실한 군대를 이끌어 파시스트 짐승들을 물리치는 일에 선택된, 야조프는 자만심이 강하며 힘에 굶주린 군벌들을 통제하는데 실패하고 연합을 끔찍한 결말로 이끌어 버렸습니다. 러시아에서의 투쟁을 이끌어줄 지도자가 없어지자, 연합은 사라지고 서로 앙숙인 장교들의 무리가 되어, 카르비셰프의 위대한 유산을 가로채기에만 급급하고 그들을 묶어주는 목적은 잊어버린지 오래입니다.\n\n야조프의 죽음과 함께, §R대시련§!은 실패했습니다. 설령 몇몇 장군들이 그들의 무가치한 영지를 지키려 시도할지라도, 주변의 강력한 군벌의 의지가 전러시아 흑색연합의 잔당들을 지워버리는 데에는 충분할 겁니다."

 POLITICS_VIKTOR_GRIGORIEV_DESC:0 "빅토르 안토노비치 그리고리예프는 다양한 성격의 소유자입니다: 용감하고, 대담하며, 확실하게도 기회주의자 입니다. 그가 그의 고향을 떠나서 붉은 군대의 부름을 듣고 들어왔을때, 그는 죽기살기로 싸웠으며, 동상에 걸린채로 전투를 치뤘으며 남아있는 적 탱크를 스스로 들이받기까지 했습니다. 그에게 남은 유일한 논리적 옵션은 흑색연합의 군대에 들어가 가망없는 싸움을 하는 거였지만, 그는 특별히 연합의 대의에 헌신하지 않았습니다.\n\n그리고리예프는 똑똑하게도 하급장교 치고는 세 서시베리아의 군벌들의 싸움에서 살아남았습니다. 죽음의 상인과의 전투 전까지는 말이죠. 그는 첫번째로 가라앉는 배를 버리고 적의 편에 섰습니다.\n\n그는 고향으로 돌아와서 굴욕을 당했지만, 그가 옴스크의 시장이자 군벌에 임명되는 데에는 걱정을 끼치지는 않았습니다. 그리고리예프는 아마도 우랄에 있는 정부의 꼭두각시일지는 몰라도 그는 말하길, 그가 계속 통제를 하고 있으면, 모든 것이 괜찮다고 말합니다."

 OMS_fueled_by_revenge:0 "증오로 움직인다"
 OMS_fueled_by_revenge_desc:0 "저번 시련에는, 우리 모두가 지상에 강림한 지옥을 보았고 마주했습니다. 나치들이 우리의 도시를 불태우고, 우리의 가족을 학살하고, 우리가 힘들게 가꾸고 건설한 연방을 산산조각 내버렸습니다. 우리 주변의 세계가 흐트러지기 시작하자, 우리는 다시 튜튼이 우리의 고향을 빼앗지 못하도록 각오를 했습니다. 다시는 우리가 우리 땅에서 나는 쿵쾅거리는 군화소리를 두려워 하는 일은 없을것입니다.\n\n 대가가 무엇이든, 희생을 얼마나 치뤄야 하든, §R대시련§!의 날은 올것입니다.\n\n 그때, 그들은 우리의 끔직한 복수를 느낄 것입니다."
 OMS_nothing_left_to_lose:0 "잃을 것이 없다"
 OMS_nothing_left_to_lose_desc:0 "우리의 뒤는 벽에 눌려있고, 우리의 보급품도 낮지만, 우리의 사기는 항상 높습니다. 모든 흑색연합의 아들딸들은 그들의 임무를 알고있고, 잃을 것도 없기 때문입니다. 왜나면 마지막 시련에서 이미 모든 것을 잃었기 때문이죠. 이 간단한 진실은 연합이 그저 툴툴거리는 베테랑의 모임이 아닌 러시아 황무지에서 견줄데 없는 규율을 가진 군대로 탈바꿈 시켰습니다.\n\n우리는 우리의 현재인, 끔직한 상황에서 살아남고, 우리가 잃어버린 것을 재건할 것입니다. 그리고 §R대시련§!의 때가 온다면, 우리는 적에게 우리가 잃어버린 모든 목숨에 대한 보복을 할것입니다."
 OMS_karbyshev_figurehead:0 "이름 뿐인 꼭두각시"
 OMS_karbyshev_figurehead_desc:0 "검은 연합의 설립자인, 카르비셰프 장군이, 그가 한떄 그랬던 것처럼 젊지 않다는 것은 슬픈 일입니다. 그가 나이를 먹어갈수록, 그의 정신은 어느때처럼 예리했지만, 그의 육체는 물러지고 약해졌습니다. 그가 더 이상 오래 살지 못하는 것에 대해 사람들은 슬퍼하지만; 모든것을 잃지는 않았습니다. 검은연합의 장교단과 충성스러운 아들딸들이 카르비셰프의 명령을 받고 전달하고, 장군의 정신이 미끄러졌을때 하는 말들도 재해석해 전달합니다. \n\n장군이 끝내달라 간청해도 그들로써는 기꺼이 행복하게 행할 것입니다."

As well, the Siberian Plan failed to industrialize Omsk, despite it being one of the largest cities in Siberia.

All crimes and previous affiliations will be forgotten. All they have to do is don the uniform of the Black Hand, and wear it to the grave.

Who knows what treason lurks in the hearts of men? Who's to say that the same people who cheer on Yazov publicly don't curse him behind his back, plotting the return of the Bolsheviks? Might there even be collaborators among us - traitors to the Russian state and people alike? If the League cannot be certain, perhaps the Black Hand can.

Beyond Russia, there are only German scum, backstabbing Japanese and traitors who allowed our great nation to perish twice over. What matters is what we know in our hearts: that this is but the first step towards the end of Russia's nightmare, towards dawn for our people, and towards the glorious, bloody day of wrath for Germany and the subhuman savages who call it home!"

It's time that we start solidifying our conquests and quashing any remaining dissent towards our administration, and by extension, our vision.\n\nThe Glavkoverkh has demanded that our armed forces begin extending our system throughout our new territories, and they shall do just that.

If Russia and the League are to have any hope of survival, we must be ready for this last cowardly act of self-destruction.\n\nAcross the nation we will build a system of bunkers and shelters based on the designs of those in Omsk. Pre-existing fortification complexes and metro systems will be reinforced and stocked with supplies to serve as emergency shelters. New, purpose-built shelters will be built in the largest cities of the nation, designed to hold as many people as possible. If the day comes when the enemy decides they would rather destroy the world than face the consequences of their choices, the Black League will shelter in the earth. When the fires have burned out we will emerge, and teach them that they cannot escape so easily."

But it was quite another thing to look the twisted remnants of your dreams in the eye every day. To be constantly greeted by people, tripping over each other to obsequiously praise the vision and beauty of your own worst nightmare.\n\nGeneral Dmitry Mikhailovich Karbyshev, Glavkoverkh of the Black League, had clung to life on this earth for eighty-two years now, and he had certainly seen worse. He had lost friends to frostbite, wolves, and concentration camp guards on the three thousand-kilometer overland trek back from Nazi captivity in Mauthausen that had made him a living legend among Russians. He was a man who could bear torture, both phyiscal and emotional. But he could feel what was coming. It was plain for him to see. He saw it in the eyes of every fresh-faced Youth Cadre recruit, in every projection of the next five years' industrial production. There it was, a simple fact, shining like the sun in every geopolitical analysis of the coming Trial, in every snippet of hopeful speculation on the future.\n\nKarbyshev's watch was coming to its end.\n\nThe thought of death, a final rest from all his earthly toil, did not faze him. But, when he looked at the nightmare around him, he felt a panicky, hot-headed sense of urgency. His beloved League had grown corrupt and cruel, ruled by officer cliques and cronyism while innocents labored away in the Redemptionary Brigades. As painful as it would be, he had to try one last time. He had to address his sin, his unfinished work on this cursed planet, before the long night claimed him."

All it took was two good hits and the left wing was sheared clean off the side of the fuselage and the plane started tumbling downard. He could barely hear his own screams over the thunder of anti-aircraft fire. He blacked out before he hit the ground, the wastes of Russia reaching up to claim him.\n\nMartin awoke face-to-face with his copilot, Johan. His face was caved in. Martin screamed and sat up. His eyes widened. The Me 264 was a fiery wreck in front of him. Hellish red and white flames licked at tangled spires of metal. Heat rolled against his skin. Next to him, his crew was laid out on the ground, their corpses mangled from the crash. A small crowd was assembled in front of the wreck, silhouetted against the flames. Some of them turned their heads in his direction. His breath hitched.\n\nHe scrambled to his feet and tried to run, but intense pain blossomed in his knee and he cried out, falling back to the ground. They were coming. "Wait, wait!" he said and turned onto his back. Three of the silhouettes rushed towards him. Their bayonets gleamed with murderous intent. He pulled himself backwards with his arms, palming fistfulls of dirt and throwing it at them. "Wait, stop, stop! Please!"

Could he not even get junior officers to follow his orders any more? Some cadres had refused to drill twice a day, while others drilled twice but only for half as long as they normally would each time. His order that meal times be shortened seemed to have been ignored entirely. No one was being punished for their disobedience, because the people responsible for carrying out the punishments were just as non-compliant as all the rest. He had held back on ordering harsh treatment for so long because he wanted to believe that the members of the League would realize the error of their ways on their own. He now saw just how naive he had been. The League was further gone than he had dared imagine. Deep inside of himself, a small voice questioned if it was still worth the effort.\n\nHe crushed that voice, as he had done so many times in the past. He had made his choice years ago when he created the League, and he was too far along to start doubting himself now. The League had wandered off course, and he would spend whatever time he had left trying to get it back on track. His legacy depended on it. Russia depended on it. He could not abandon his nation, not when so many people already had. He believed, before all else, in Russia. One, indivisible, invincible. So long as he lived there would remain at least one member of the League who stayed true to its principles. They were all he had left."

They crowded around Karbyshev and his meager retinue of bodyguards, eyeing the old soldier with wariness and an indescribable emotion that felt almost like hunger.\n\n"I'm not here to punish you," Karbyshev said as loud as he dared. "I want to give you a chance at redemption." A voice piped up from the crowd.\n\n"The last time we were offered 'redemption' by you lot, fifteen men died in a cave-in. Starting to seem like there's not a whole lot of difference 'tween the two." The foreman's face turned bleach-white, his hands reflexively clenching. But he had braced himself for a punishment that never came.\n\n"Real redemption," Karbyshev answered. "Not the same old lie you've been getting from the officers. Actual freedom." The crowd collectively murmured. "Whatever you did to get here, it'll be wiped away, and you'll be equal with us. A lot of you never even did anything worth getting here.

That the children of soldiers lived in elaborate air raid shelters beneath the ground, and dined on army rations and canned meat packaged when Bukharin still ruled Russia. For a free man, or even one fortunate enough to be born and raised in one of the few countries on the globe that could count itself as being at least somewhat free and stable, such a proposition would seem hellish. But for a man who had seen his childhood home torched by two different German armies, his friends and neighbors bayoneted by bandits, and who held onto his two grandchildren as his last worldly possession of any import, such a deal did not seem so bad. It was true, he reasoned, that tyranny was odious.\n\nBut in his painful life which had seen the rise and fall of no less than three different Russias, he had known tyranny's cold hand in many forms. He had learned to accept it, and live alongside it, regarding it as simply a shadow in the corner - a thing to be acknowledged and worked around, and little else. And so as Fyodor's refugee caravan approached the checkpoint at the purported border of Omsk's Black League, wind whipping at the ragged coat he had stretched over himself and his grandchildren, he felt only security and a sense of relief when black-uniformed men with guns approached them. His journey across his broken homeland had taken him through countless governments and their hollow promises. Time and time again their lies had nearly taken away from him all that he cared for.

But on these windswept steppes where borders were just an idea, the League's presence in small villages often amounted to little more than a few under-equipped frontline or garrison cadres.\n\nFor what it was worth, they acquitted themselves well. The men and women of cadres 103858, 109663, and 109667 fought as best they could to protect the agricultural workers stationed there, but they were caught off-guard by the bandits' brazen raid. But by about 9:00 that night, it was all over, their lives either already snuffed out or draining away fast.

Five full cadres of well-armed infantry made a quarter-circle as they moved towards the clearing where the drunken bandits enjoyed their revelry.\n\nThere was a click of bipods unfolding, the soft ticks of safeties, and the crunch of soldiers laying prone in soft snow.\n\n"Pick your targets, and wait for the signal."\n\nAfter what felt like ages, a squawk came over the radio.\n\n"Open fire."\n\nThe ill-conceived party became a hellscape within seconds. Tracers ripped through tents, horses, men, trees, everything in sight. Some were shot where they sat, drinking and yelling, others had time to emerge, stumbling, from their tents, only to be shot down in an orgy of violence.

Waiters scurried to cross the invisible line in the middle of the room, seemingly afraid of the psychic consequences of standing near such a powerfully charged faultline. One one side of the table - a menagerie of unimportant functionaries, Karbyshev among them, his face recalling some timeless, monolithic statue. His dispassion said all that was needed. On the other, the old guard, stolid, intransigent, and unabashed.\nIn the background, muffled by walls, there were gunshots.\n"Glavkoverkh," Abakumov intoned with a bare minimum of effort, "I regret to interrupt this luncheon with such an uproar, but a plot was uncovered against the leadership of our League." He paused for effect, throwing a glance at the men seated at his side. "It has been dealt with." Karbyshev, of course, knew all too well what was happening, and his heart sank. It was all over, and his plan - no, HE, had failed. But he would not go down quietly. Abakumov, or one of his cronies, was in the middle of gloating when a withering stare crossed the room, his words falling to the floor like a dead bird.\n"Ten years now," Karbyshev almost whispered before raising his volume tenfold. "Ten years now, you people I once called my comrades have betrayed my trust, and since then I have been nothing but window dressing for your continued victimization of our people. I have watched you send women and children to war armed with museum pieces." He paused, rising from the table and letting his chair fall to the floor. "I see you for who you are now. You rats are just as treasonous as Vlasov and his vermin," Karbyshev spat with pure venom, animated by a terrible anger.

The young officer was technically Karbyshev's countryman, in a way - Karbyshev himself was of Tatar (albeit, Siberian, and Orthodox) extraction, and Magomedov hailed from Tatarstan proper. But nationality wasn't why the Glavkoverkh had insisted on this man serving as his assistant for the past decade.\n\n"Have you seen the doctor's report?" asked Karbyshev. Magomedov shook his head. The Glavkoverkh poured two glasses of vodka and motioned his aide over, gesturing to a chair next to his desk. Once Magomedov was seated with his drink, Karbyshev continued. "Nothing you probably don't already know, or haven't heard on the grapevine." He took a long sip of vodka, his eyes almost wistful. "Doctor says I'm not long for this world. Kidneys are going out, plus half a dozen other things." Magomedov's face went white, not so much because he was unaware of this fact as because responding to such a statement was not the easiest task. Karbyshev sensed this immediately, and filled the void instead. "I know, not the easiest line to follow up on."\n\n"One way to put it, I suppose," replied Magomedov, gathering his wits. "Have you figured out...you know, final wishes and such?"\n\n"In the process of doing so. But I assure you, you can have anything from my office and quarters when I go."

Karbyshev responded. "She's smarter than I am, truth be told. Got out when she still could." His eyes grew distant, as if imagining another time, and what could have been. "But I've got a thing for lost causes, I suppose. I stayed, and this monstrosity was built up around me. Built on me."\n"Dmitry, I..." Magomedov stumbled, at a loss for words. "...I really can't express my thanks. But... Dmitry, why me?"\n"You know, you're one of the only people who calls me that. Just 'Dmitry.'"\n"That's because you asked me to, sir."\n"I ask everyone to do that. They don't. Even Yazov can't bring himself to. And it's part of why I care about what happens to you after I'm gone. See, when Yelena defected, I knew it was for the best. But that took away one of the last people who would sit down and talk to me as a human being, as a friend, and not just worship me or try to get favors. You're practically the only one left now. I sit up here in heaven, and watch all the people down below file into church, as it were, and pay their respects. And then their little ceremonies end and they all go back to ignoring me and everything I stood for. I'm not a real person to them anymore - just an image, a myth." The old man sat back in his chair.

Every day Karbyshev seemed a little smaller, a little weaker. Most days he didn't leave his bedroom, not even to go to his office down the hall. His voice barely rose above a whisper now, and he struggled to hold a pen to write with. All of these were concerning on their own, but they were not what disturbed Yazov.\n\nWhen he looked into Karbyshev's eyes he had once seen fire and passion. In the last few years that passion had gone, replaced with a grim determination that he still admired. But a few weeks ago he had noticed the determination had left his mentor's eyes too. Now there was something new. Acceptance. Karbyshev would never say it aloud, but Yazov knew his teacher had surrendered to his fate. He didn't want to believe that Karbyshev would allow himself to fade away into nothingness. The fire that had once burned within him must still exist somewhere inside. Every so often Yazov would try to coax some passion or excitement out of the old general, but he never succeeded. One day while they were both working in Karbyshev's bedroom, Yazov heard a small chuckle from behind him. He turned to see the frail man his teacher had become sitting up on his bed.\n\n"What is it sir?"\n\n"I was just thinking about my legacy, about what I'll be leaving the world with once I go on to whatever's next."\n\n"You'll have a wonderful legacy sir.

All the papers strewn across his desk were now little more than butterflies without wings.\n\nPerhaps a walk outside would clear things up. It wasn't like there was any other option left.

Yet at the same time he felt invisible - the only person who even asked his business was Magomedov, slumped half-awake behind a security desk.\n\nAs the cold nighttime wind whipped against Karbyshev's old frame, he felt a strange sense of peace. Certainly, it was one tinged with sorrow - sorrow that he had not done enough, that he could not do more. Yet the hot, heavy anguish that had wracked him for the past five years was gone. Looking up at the snowy night sky, watching the snowflakes emerging from the darkness, the old general felt as if he had done his part. What would be, would be. Letting the faintest hint of a smile creep across his wrinkled face, he waved to the sentries at the guardhouse as he walked out the main gate of the command compound and strode into a copse of trees, towards the riverbank. Half-frozen by the early Siberian winter, the little creek babbled softly at the general's feet, lapping up against the icy ground.

Every industrial cadre assigned to each underground plant was told this, and knew this. For if they were to survive the next war, nothing could be spared in the defense of these factories. They would be the engine that kept Omsk running."

The instructor of their Youth Cadre lectured them on how evil the Germans were and how their bombs killed Outsiders on the surface. But Sofiya didn't believe it. For one thing, she had never seen an Outsider. She'd only heard stories - how they ate dirt, wore rags, and lived in holes in the ground instead of barracks, without cadres or instructors. Vasya, the new kid, always cried whenever they told stories like this, but everyone knew they were true.\n\nWhenever the bombs came, the sirens would start to play, and the whole cadre would be sent down into the shelters beneath the surface. So instead of doing physical exercises or learning about the Germans, the children would run through the tunnels, playing war while the bomb-sounds thumped up above, rumbling like soft thunder.\n\nBut now these days were becoming rarer and rarer. Sofiya and her cadre were now braving the outdoors more and more often, and these coveted playtimes beneath the earth became less and less frequent.

The fate of the Russian nation, all on his shoulders. Out of all the officers in all the League, Karbyshev had trusted him.\n\nWas he really ready? All of Russia was against them. The world would be, as well, once they saw the strength of the Russian nation united. And the ultimate foe, Germany, would not sit idly by and wait for its destruction. Surely this was hopeless. What he wanted most to do was to crawl back in a bunker and forget he had ever been born, to forget Karbyshev's impossible dream and become just another officer.\n\nTo run.\n\nBut that would not do. Russia needed a leader, and though he would be an imperfect instrument, he would act. He would look to the heroes of the First Trial, to the proud Russian nation, and to Karbyshev's determination for his strength. All the fear of what he had to be, and the doubts about what he was, were cast aside by a newfound clarity of purpose.

He was overjoyed when many of his officers and old comrades volunteered to join the League and help him save the motherland. If only they had stayed true to their word and not fallen astray. Perhaps even then they had simply concealed their cynicism from him, and had always planned to use the League as a path to personal health and power. The old general prayed it wasn't so. He did not want to consider that so many of his friends might have always been this corrupt and power-hungry. But then, if the League had made them this way, was that any better?\n\nHe had spoken with Kharkhardin yesterday about the growing corruption in the League and what might be done about it. As always happened when he brought these things to Alexander, he was gently chastised for making mountains out of mole hills when there were more important issues to focus on. He didn't have the heart to tell Aleksander he knew that he was skimming money off the budget for his personal projects. It wouldn't have mattered if he had. Just like all of Karbyshev's other old friends, Kharkhardin seemed to think of him as more of a puppet than an ally these days, someone to prop up for the League while profiting off of its members.\n\nKarbyshev inserted a piece of paper into his typewriter and began to write another memo laying out a plan to eliminate corruption in the League's ranks. He knew it would be ignored. All of the others had been, but he could not give up now. His motherland needed him, and he would not abandon her, even if everyone else had."

I have also uncovered extensive networks of corruption from high ranking members of the League. I shall not identify names here as I believe in offering a chance at redemption to all, but let me be clear that if this corruption continues there shall be consequences for all of us.

Out there, in the blur of the distance, the shouts of men and gunfire rang in the air. Today, too, was a day of preparation for the Great Trial. Near him was an empty chair. Comrade Karbyshev was not here today. Yazov shook his head, brushing his face with a gloved hand. Thoughts of betrayal assailed the protégé's mind, only for a slight tremor in the air to banish them.\n\n"Your coffee, sir?" the steward said. Yazov gave him a faint smile. "Banish those forms of address, comrade. We are all equal to our duty," he said, "but yes, for now, I will take coffee." The steward gave a little bow, perhaps unused to the notion of equality among the ranks of the League, and laid down his cup in front of him. In the chilly morning air, wisps of steam trail the jet-black liquid. Yazov took it and held it in front of him, staring down at the cold, hard-set eyes reflected in those dark depths, letting the scent immerse him in the memories of things long gone. He took the rim to his lips and drank.\n\nThey flooded him in an instant, the rich aroma guiding him through the whirling pool of his mind. He remembered his first taste of coffee, from before the Fall. Then he came upon a scene of comrades breaking bread in the freezing weather of the winter battlefield, hearing the firewood crackle. He let an unseen tear gather in his eyes. They're all dead now. Yazov put his cup down, gritting his teeth. He held it out for a few moments, pondering whether to finish his drink. Against common sense, he did.\n\nHe found the fragrance guiding him away from the turmoil of the Great Patriotic War. Yazov drifted where it led him. Dearest Omsk, dearest homeland! He had sat in the cramped and huddled camps of refugees fleeing the west, the blood the Germans spilled staining even half the world away. He remembered the harsh and bitter coffee of that place and the dank and sour smell that surrounded him. At that precipice, the coffee ceased to be. Yazov stared at the bottom of the cup and smirked.

They were a real fighting force now, comparable and even superior to the best that Siberia could muster. Maybe it was time to rest his tired eyes. He removed his cap and tossed it onto the desk.

Half again as many were also wounded, and they were desperately low on all sorts of medical supplies. He didn't even feel angry at anyone in particular- in fact, his unit had performed quite well, holding their own and giving far worse than they got.

Our scouts have reported they have withdrawn from the field completely and are heading east at full speed. Should we pursue them?"\n\n"I don't think so. They nearly overwhelmed us here. It's best not to push our luck. Tell your men to start counting casualties, ours and theirs. I want a report as soon as possible."\n\n"Yes sir."\n\nThe lieutenant scurried away and Fedorov turned back towards the grim view. He refused to let it show, but the way the Black League's soldiers had fought disturbed him. They came on relentlessly, with no concern for their lives. If he hadn't seen them bleed with his own eyes he would have been convinced they were robots. This had not been their full strength either.

Even with Yazov as his designated heir, the old generals had seized Karbyshev's passing as their opportunity to attempt to break free. Yazov knew that the League could not survive another succession crisis. Without him, the Black League would collapse from within and without. All of this would have been for nothing. Russia would be doomed.\n\nYazov resolved not to repeat the mistakes of his mentor. The Black League was bigger than any one man, and the motherland's salvation could not depend on him alone. What the League needed was reorganization, from top to bottom. The League would become an entity unto itself, even its most prominent members merely small parts of the great leviathan that would see Russia avenged. Yazov called his councillors and generals to his office. By the time they arrived he was already hard at work. They labored long into the night, until the plan was complete.\n\nThey sent out the first orders the very next day. Every officer of the Black League was to nominate a successor, to maintain the chain of command should he be incapacitated, and a secondary successor should his first choice be incapacitated as well. Every position from field marshal to sergeant would be required to have two levels of contingencies ready. The frontline troops would not be spared their share of the responsibility. It would be their duty to prepare themselves to fight without their officers, to continue the League's struggle even if their leaders could not. The soldiers would obey their commanders, but they would fight for the Black League, because as long as the Black League existed, Russia could never die."

Some days ago, when our dear comrade Supreme Commander Karbyshev passed, I was named his designated successor in his last will and testament." Somewhere in a bunker below Omsk, Yazov paused, knowing that he would now have to admit the unthinkable - there had nearly been a coup within the League. "Certain opportunistic and treasonous elements of this League's leadership attempted to prevent the execution of our great Marshal's plan. They have been dealt with in accordance with the military justice of our League."\n\n"I speak to you today to announce a change of course. Under the direct leadership of Glavkoverkh Karbyshev, our League was a model of efficiency and effectiveness, and made tremendous progress in the reunification of the Russian nation and its total preparation for the Great Trial. Yet, for the past five years, a cancer has begun to grow within our state, festering, rotting away within our very flesh and corrupting the correct guidance of our founder. And today, it has finally been excised."\n\n"In nature, there is no quarter for the weak, no mercy for those incapable of securing their own existence. The same is true in the affairs of human beings. We cannot, will not, must not let sentimentality, corruption, and favoritism come before our ultimate priority - ensuring that Russia has a future. We must make the Russian the apex predator of the Eurasian continent. In the coming days, I will speak to you again more and outline the changes that are in store. But for now, this is your commander speaking. Our cause is just. Victory will be ours. Good night.""

Some of them had flunked out, while others had broken under the weeks of physical and mental torment they had endured. There was no room for weakness in the ranks of the Black Guard, and those who survived the training had no weakness left in them.

There was no celebration of the occasion. The guards could celebrate when they had avenged Russia, but until that day they would be allowed no joy, no sense of accomplishment.\n\n"Glazkov, Arkady."\n\nArkady took the short walk towards the podium, gave a crisp salute to the captain, and exited the stage. As he walked down the stairs he felt a spark of pride in his new status. He crushed this last internal rebellion. He was truly a member of the guard now.

So far only a few saboteurs have been captured alive, and while they have refused to talk even under advanced interrogation methods, we have been able to discern that they originate from Omsk. It seems the Black League has dispatched a small army of spies and operatives to our nation to try to halt our buildup and prevent us from mounting any organized military campaigns. This is likely only the first step to make us a softer target before a full invasion. Already our units have been placed on high alert and border patrols have been increased to prevent any more League agents from slipping into our territory. However, the damage that has already been done is significant and it will take some time to repair, as well as to track down the remaining saboteurs who we have not yet captured.

The two cups sat in the cold, their steam streaming into the air in smooth wisps, before dissipating. He leaned back in his chair, growing sleepy as worry and concern faded from the creases of his face. Comrade Karbyshev was not so weak that a chilly wind could kill him. He would return and lead the League to glory. He squinted. Now was not the moment to grow complacent. What would the man think of him if he found Yazov dozing off before their appointed meeting?\n\nYazov sat up, his elbows on his knees, tapping his fingers as the hours passed and the day stretched to the evening. The cold breeze blew between the trees, and the training field grew silent as men trooped to dinner and other martial business. The stern clouds looked to the Earth and seemed to grow greyer and greyer in disappointment or wrath. Still, Karbyshev did not appear. He was old, however, and maybe his creaky joints made him late. Yazov laughed, but it was hollow. Aides and officers came out of the offices, begging him to return to his quarters. A storm grew in the distance, and the clouds grew stark, steely in outlook.\n\nThe sun went down, and snow fell. First in a gentle dusting, then as a thick, heavy blanket. The cool breeze became a frigid gale. The cool breeze became lashes of frozen air. Still, Yazov sat, waiting, his fingers clasped together, breathing with every shiver and shock. An aide, braving through the harsh weather, came beside him. Yazov was still. "Sir," the aide said, "it might be time to rest. You will sadden Comrade Karbyshev deeply if he returns."\n\nYazov stood.

The shattered bones of an old world painted across the horizon, reaching up to the heavens, but forever trapped with the discarded people who had built them in a past age.\n\nBut, overtop of the city, a layer of atmosphere was brushed thick - air raid sirens painted it in broad strokes of oppression and fear. The wash of crackled words, murmured through half-broken speakers demanding the citizens return to their homes, mixed anxiety into the palette.\n\nLower down, in the dark bowels of the city, the composition was ongoing; thousands of dark-clothed oppressors, each one a brush, painted their heavy boots across the streets.\n\nAll those wide eyed rabble viewing the great scene from their windows could do nothing but accept the artistry before them.\n\nYazov had become the grand painter of the city, perhaps all of Russia.

It costs lives to burn them out of their holes, but we are prepared to pay that price without complaint.

He thought back to the fear he had felt going into this grand venture, and he saw it reflected in the eyes of the men around him. His head sunk, unable to meet their stares.\n\nA shout, then the screech of tires and an explosion. The world collapsed inwards, and then gave way as the vehicle's armored carapace broke open around Yazov, the world spinning before his slackened eyes. For a moment, he was conscious once again, the world still and in perfect clarity. He marveled at how bright red his own blood was, how elegantly the flames danced on the APC's remains.

Every officer in the League must now watch their back and work their hardest, lest they fall prey to the newly-instituted "efficiency investigations" and find themselves demoted, or worse.

Not physically - it was cramped, damp, and smelled of mold, but in a more existential sense. This kind of war - the kind he now felt himself immersed in - was something he could rationalize and understand. The last few weeks of chaos and civil disorder had been a disorienting, vertigo-inducing sequence of events for Innokentiy, a veteran of the failed effort to reclaim West Russia in the 1950s. The war that was now being fought was nothing like the one he had seen waged ten years ago. The conflict within the Black League came and went in fits and starts, with brief engagements interspersed within long, endless hours and days of tension and speculation. The front lines seemed to appear and disappear at will, as political machinations within the higher ranks made foes suddenly become friends and vice versa. Rarely could Innokentiy enjoy the adrenaline rush of a straight fight, or the feeling of a well-executed infiltration. But today was such a day, and, as he looked at the bunker complex a few broken city blocks away, he couldn't help but feel quite pleased with himself.\n\nA distant "thud" from within the compound let Innokentiy know that his work had come to bloody fruition, in one way or another. The handoff of the explosive-laden briefcase last night had gone off without a hitch, and it seemed that his contact had successfully set off the device, at least. It wasn't until the appointed signal - a staccato series of six gunshots, in groups of threes, that Innokentiy knew that Viktor Abakumov was dead."

An NKVD man who found Karbyshev's ideal of a strengthened and renewed Russia attractive for all the wrong reasons, it is unlikely that many outside of the officer cliques he held together will mourn his passing.\n\nWithin hours of Abakumov's death, tensions among his shellshocked co-conspirators seem to have boiled over into open warfare, and with gunfire reported inside of Isilkul, Black League units were able to sweep in and mop up any remaining resistance with relative ease. Yazov's dream lives on for another day, but there is no rest yet for the Glavkoverkh - a revolt still festers in Tara."

For a moment, he was back at Volokolamsk in 1940, fighting a losing battle against the oncoming German tide. And then, a moment later, he was on the outskirts of Tara once more, distant gunfire beating out a harsh tattoo in his ears.\n\nCadre Leader Pavlov's cohort was certainly not used to actual frontline combat, let alone against men who had until recently been their sworn comrades-in-arms. Then again, combat wasn't exactly in their job description - Pavlov's cadre was a reserve cadre, known in Black League parlance as a "chetvyorka," or "four," due to the fact that their six-digit designation began with that number. Normally, such units, often composed of older soldiers seen as being past their prime, were relegated to the duties of keeping the non-League members in line, and making sure that the civilians stayed quiet and met their production quotas.\n\nBut today, as had the days before it, had not been an ordinary day. As he broke down the door of a grey, dreary civilian dwelling with a few chosen subordinates, Pavlov reflected on how utterly unthinkable this situation would have been only a few months ago. Men he once would have died to save were now his mortal enemies. With a splash of dust, the rotten door split open, termites wriggling from its fragments on the ground as the reservists rushed in and corralled the building's occupants. The civilians cowered before him and his black-uniformed men with a practiced ease sharpened by years of living under the Black League's "protection." As usual, it didn't take much to make them comply - the end of a PPSh was excellent for loosening a person's tongue. Moments later, Pavlov had the target's location, and had rejoined the rest of his cadre back on the dusty road. The ring around Tara was almost complete."

While the news of Abakumov's death and the collapse of the Isilkul putsch seems to have not fazed the Tara conspirators, the defeat of Old Guard forces and the subsequent encirclement of the city certainly has.\n\nThe revolt's leaders have now run up the white flag of truce, and have agreed to surrender to Yazov's forces in exchange for any potential death sentences being commuted to Redemptionary Service, though it remains unclear whether the Glavkoverkh actually intends to honor this pledge. Regardless, it seems that the Old Guard's rebellion has finally ended."

He saw the nervous energy in their eyes, and fought to not meet it with his own, steeling himself, forcing his mind back into the familiarity and certainty of the past. To the Gauntlet, and how he had been decisive and strong. Like Karbyshev. He'd just do his speech, and forget about the fear.\n\n"Comrade soldiers," Yazov began, using that familiar phrase that Karbyshev had been so fond of. "Today, by proving our strength, we prove our worthiness to rule Russia. Your deeds today will prove the fundamental nature of the universe - the strong rule, and the weak perish. Your deeds will prove that WE, the All-Russian Black League, are the sole salvation of this nation and its millennium of civilization. So, though today you may fight your own countrymen, fight as if you were facing down the Führer himself! Because if we fail today, there IS no tomorrow, and Russia will perish once and for all at the hands of the superpowers when the Great Trial comes. So go forth, and carve your names into history!" Yazov was satisfied with his delivery, and a cheer broke out. And now, the final, personal touch that was uniquely his. "Our cause is just," he shouted to further cheers, giving voice once more to those words he had heard on the radio when it all began in 1941. "The enemy will be destroyed. Victory will be ours!"\n\nThe speech was over in what seemed like an instant, the words flowing from him without comprehension.

Behind him the rest of his cadre was doing their morning drills, checking their weapons, and preparing for breakfast. Ahead of him stretched an endless grassland, disappearing into the darkness. About fifty meters out into that grassland was an invisible line, the line that separated the All-Russian Black League from the traitors and cowards that sought to undermine Russia. Borders were a fluid and often fanciful concept in Russia nowadays, but according to the map they had, the line was out there and they were not to cross it. Not yet, anyway.\n\nTechnically there were no plans for war with the Bolshevik scoundrels in Tyumen, and any talk of such was a rumor started by the men. Technically Combat Cadre 154376, along with almost every other combat cadre in the League, had been moved to the border as part of a training exercise. The order to be combat-ready at all times had nothing to do with the escalating border clashes between the League and the communists to the north. Officially everything was business as usual, but the simple fact that the cadre commanders were making no effort to silence talk among the ranks of an invasion was enough proof for everyone. War was coming.\n\nStaring out into the predawn darkness, Andrei couldn't help but be excited. He knew that he shouldn't be, after all it was his fellow Russians he would be going into battle against, but he had trained for war since he was 14 years old. He would finally be able to serve his purpose for the League and avenge the Motherland. He did not want to fight for glory.

The bunkers and tunnels first built by the West Siberian People's Republic were only the foundation for the massive network of fortifications and redoubts constructed on the orders of Karbyshev. The paranoia of the Black League has taken physical form. The lines of fortified gun emplacements, trenches, and minefields stretch from the borders of the League all the way back to its heart in Omsk. The very landscape of western Siberia has been weaponized against all outside intrusion.\n\nAs Karbyshev's influence weakened, the squabbling generals of the old guard grew lax in their maintenance of these mighty fortifications. They only cared for the defences that protected their personal holdings, thinking exclusively of themselves and not of Russia's needs. Only when Yazov vanquished the traitors did he realize the sorry state the defences were in. He had reunified the League and its territory, and now that he had consolidated his control he would not lose it to an outside invader.\n\nAs the league prepares for war every step has been taken to make sure the home front is ready. The Last Trial has taught the Russian people that they must expect the war to come to them, and under the Black League's guidance they will be ready if it does. The league has conscripted everyone within its borders to restore the fortifications in and around Omsk. Trenches are deepened and reinforced. Old bunkers are cleaned out and refitted. Anti-air crews reposition their guns towards the border to counter an aerial opponent. As Russia's reclamation draws near the anticipation in Omsk is palpable. These last weeks of preparation will decide Russia's fate. Yazov and the rest of the Black League refuse to cede a single inch of Russian soil to the enemy uncontested."

By all accounts it should have taken a few months to wipe out Yazov's treacherous cult.

"This him, sir?" asked Luka, spitting away the end of his cigarette.\n\nKazimir ran a finger down the list to find the name again, glancing at the captive to see if the description fit. "Seventeen or eighteen, red hair, narrow jaw, corporal's stripes... Yeah, that's probably him." He jerked his head in the direction of the interview rooms. "Alright, back to it."\n\nThe officers moved towards the hallway, but Maksim stopped beside Kazimir's desk, looking thoughtful for a moment. The senior officer glanced up at his subordinate with a frown. "Problem, Sergeant?" he asked.\n\nMaksim shook his head. "No, sir, sorry, I was just thinking... We need new drill bits. The last guy's ribs blunted our last one. Can you put in a requisition for us?"\n\nKazimir nodded curtly, and with that his subordinates set off down the hall to torture a teenager to death for information he didn't have."

There was always another false claimant to the epithet of 'legitimate government'. It was in the nature of the League to never be understood by lesser men. Even come the Great Trial, Russia would still be crawling with turncoats and faint-hearted pacifists who refused to see the purity and valor of his hate. There was only one answer: an iron boot, perpetually grinding them into the dirt while its wearer conducted the symphony of war.\n\nFor today Yazov had his triumph, but tomorrow?

In Sverdlovsk and Tyumen, these rebels have succeeded in forcing out our local garrisons and now have proclaimed the Russian National Salvation Commission from their headquarters in Sverdlovsk.\n\nWe have succeeded in identifying several key characters of the rebellion, among them Karbyshev's daughter, Yelena Karbysheva, a great betrayal. Ivan Bagramyan, a prominent figure in subjugated Sverdlovsk, has reportedly joined the rebels along with Ernest Voznesensky from Tyumen and Hamazasp Babadzhdanian of Sverdlovsk. All evidence points towards these individuals working together in planning this.\n\nPavel Batov is known for his skill in military organization and strategy, which explains the dangerous success of his movement in such a short time. His ability to manage Sverdlovsk for as long as he did is a testament to such abilities, and we believe that without this competent "head" the rebellion is doomed to fail, making him a key target. The traitor Yelena Karbysheva acts as the head of inter-state affairs and is already reaching out to our rivals for support, and her close personal history with our former leader makes her especially dangerous as well. Ivan Bagramyan and Hamazasp Babadzhdanian are both former Soviet generals who served in the First Trial but now find themselves opposing us.\n\nWe must act quickly to ensure the early death of the rebellion! While they are weaker than us now, they have the advantage of fighting on ground where the foolish population supports them, and unless we move to wipe them out who knows how strong they will grow..."

 omskbatov.2.d:0 "Nikolay peered at the compound through his sniper scope, the grey tenement appearing bulbous and discombobulated around the edges. Its facade might as well be Marshal Batov's tomb-stone: the Black League had tracked the insurgent to his corner, where he can no longer escape. Still, it appeared magnificent - the sandbags on every window, machine guns polished to glinting in the early morning sun. Pavel Batov had chosen not to go with a whimper, but a statement. Nikolay liked that, even if the Marshal was a traitor to the motherland.\n\nCrackling on the radio. Nikolay took and lit his final cigarette before the operation began. To steady his hands, as he stated to his superiors. Optimally he would have also requested a can of coffee beans and a reclining chair, but he digressed. He was growing sarcastic of the proceedings in the League. At least it was good pay and good food. They paid high rates for snipers - both against them and with them.\n\nIn the distance, a faint explosion boomed through the air, its reverberance barely halting before a whistling sounded. Then, an earth-shattering boom. Black League troops, dressed in camouflage, took this as their signal. In waves and waves, they advanced against the grey tomb, as machine-guns turned their lambent gaze to perforate their bodies with lead. More mortar shells, more troops, more guns, until the rapid gunfire halted, replaced with sporadic, pathetic pops.\n\nBatov stepped out from the backside of the building, alone, unguarded. Here was Nikolay's quarry: the former Marshal of the West Siberian Military District. With one press of a trigger, he let loose a bullet that would nail Batov in the shoulder. Three Black League troops followed him, but he pulled his trusty Tokarev, and shot, shot, shot. It all happened too quickly for Nikolay to follow, but when he set to finish the Marshal off, he halted.\n\nHe saw Batov crawl over the concrete pavement, a single hand scaling a gravity-less cliff, blood trailing behind him. Soon, he would stop, and his head would sag. He was dead."

Yelena left him not long after.\n\nThey brought her to an open-topped military car, ready for her perusal. Perhaps, out there in the west, she can find refuge and bring news of the madman Yazov's plans. The Black League had betrayed her father's beliefs. She did not want to rule nor take power; she only saw what love had powered, now only hate ruled. Seated at the back of the car, she saw the buildings and tenements of the small town and vowed to return.\n\nThen her chauffeur turned the engines on and pressed the gas pedal. The car did not roar alive, instead, only a click, and a ticking.\n\nBefore she could warn and get out of it, she was consumed by the flames and the inferno."

The once-mighty Glavkoverkh sat sprawled on top of - or maybe it was under - one of the car's seats, his limbs twisted into some pattern he couldn't quite comprehend through the adrenaline fog. Something kept him warm - it could have been blood, but he wasn't sure.\n\nThe crunch of footsteps outside and the shouts of insurgents sounded his requiem. His primal instincts screamed at him, pleading with him to run, defend himself, anything. But something within the Glavkoverkh was simply done, vanquished, spent. This wasn't a heroic or memorable death. But, fate had made it his.\n\nA face - or was it two? - suddenly loomed in the smashed window, indistinct and blurry to Yazov's unfocused eyes. Some indeterminate sounds echoed in the distance, but Yazov was no longer interested. A cold, silent paralysis began to grip him, and his thoughts grew indistinct, incomprehensible even to himself. His own head grew distant, numb, his consciousness shrinking and shrinking and receding back away from his eyes into a single, infinitesimal point, until, somewhere, the last stirrings of life within Dmitry Timofeyevich Yazov fell silent."

He was probably pressuring the young man too hard for situations outside both of their control, but if there was hope, Savintsev hoped to be the first one to hear it. He could hear the buzzing of the ham radio, as Black League personnel scramble frantically through all the radio channels available to them.\n\n"Nothing, sir," the young man said to him, face pale. "Nothing at all. I have tried contacting the bases in Tyumen, Sverdlovsk, everything. No response." Under Savintsev's steady and skeptical gaze, his resolve seemed to melt. Perhaps he did find something after all, buried in the recesses of his mind.\n\n"Are you sure?"\n\n"Y-yes, sir. Although..."\n\n"Although? Please be straight with me, soldier."\n\n"There was an unencrypted radio signal that one of the other radiomen found. He said that he was going to pass it up straight to you, but I guess he didn't."

Batov could tell you stories of that one recruit who showed up wearing a metal pan for a helmet for days. Still, everyone there was united in a singular purpose: to rage against the dark, to triumph over the Black League.\n\n"Hell yeah, I did, sir!" Batov admired that sort of enthusiasm. Military work was, at the same time, ludicrous and dull. It was dry one moment and the next you could be paddling up a creek, knee-deep in blood. A spot of comedy and humor could help one get used to it quicker. Pavel patted the sergeant's shoulders and dismissed him.\n\nEntering his inner "office," he saw his high-ranked officers gathered before him. Ivan Bagramyan, trusted quartermaster. Yelena, daughter of Karbyshev. Ernest Voznesensky, the old economic official he had inherited from Kaganovich. Hamazasp Babadzhanian, stranger in a strange land.\n\nHis grin slowly hardened into a stern visage. "Bagramyan, I want you to prepare the government.

 omskbatov.7.d:0 "For months the forces of the West Siberian Provisional Authority and the Russian National Salvation Commission have battled across the war-torn landscape of western Siberia. Little by little, the underground army has pushed back the forces of the Black League, reducing the areas where its soldiers could operate safely and striking from the shadows when they were least expected. The commanders of the Black League convinced themselves that this was just another partisan organization, larger and more organized than most, but they would still be crushed. That lie became harder and harder to believe as the League's authority continued to evaporate outside of its strongholds, but the tipping point came with Yazov's assassination.\n\nWith the head of the Black League cut off, its weakness was made plain for all to see. The illusion of total control was broken and could never be repaired. Massive uprisings took place and the Salvation Commission launched an organized military uprising, seizing control over much of western Siberia. Now the surviving officers of the Black League have taken shelter in Omsk once again. They are desperately trying to contact their remaining forces scattered across their former territory. Only a holdout garrison in Vorkuta has responded. Everyone else is either already dead or simply saw which way the wind is blowing and decided not to go down with the ship.\n\nIn the tunnels and bunkers of Omsk desperate plans are being drawn up to retake western Siberia and continue the Black League's mission, but all but the most deluded officers know this is a mere fantasy borne out of panic more than anything else. The Black League is done, its mission is a failure. Russia may still be unified one day, but it will not be under Yazov's vision. The only thing left for the League to do is quietly die out like so many dreams before it."

The officers went door to door, arresting anyone suspected of working for the so-called "Russian National Salvation Commission." The main targets were the local leaders of the insurgency, especially those who were operating from within the city government itself. Most of the suspects were caught off guard and apprehended without incident. A few attempted to run but were quickly caught or gunned down. Others chose to take their own life rather than surrender, saving the directorate the trouble of dealing with them. By the time the sun was up, hundreds were behind bars, dozens were dead, and most of the city had been secured.\n\nA few of the rebel leaders got word of what was happening and attempted to make their escape. Realizing the city was surrounded, they rallied their supporters, three dozen men and women in total, and took control of a warehouse on the edge of Zlatoust. The staff of the warehouse were taken hostage, and the rebels used the weapons and materials stockpiled within to fortify their position. The 29th League Infantry Battalion surrounded the warehouse, cutting off all means of escape, but was instructed not to storm the position to avoid unnecessary casualties. What resulted was a multi-hour standoff that lasted into the evening. Eventually it was decided that the warehouse and its contents were expendable, and an airstrike destroyed the building and everyone inside of it. The city is now firmly under our control once more."

The efforts of Batov's terrorists have turned the city into a miniature warzone, with frequent bombings and hit-and-run ambushes against the city's garrison. Increasing the number of soldiers present in the city has only resulted in a rise in attacks against them. To prevent the situation from devolving further into chaos it was decided that a new approach should be tried. Intelligence officers and secret police have spent the last weeks infiltrating terrorist cells throughout the city, locating their safehouses and warning of planned attacks. These agents have uncovered a network of partisans that extends across the whole city and even into the surrounding villages. With their entire organization laid bare, a more permanent solution was now available.\n\nThis afternoon, the spy's work bore fruit. As the rebels prepared for a series of coordinated strikes, their units were suddenly ambushed by well concealed soldiers of the city garrison. By the time the partisans realized their cover had been blown it was too late. Dozens of partisan soldiers were killed in the first wave of counter-ambushes, and before their commanders could mount an effective response they found their safehouses had been exposed. Combat cadres across the city dragged hundreds of terrorists out of their safe rooms and bolt holes. A few surrendered but most fought to the death. By the day's end the tally was 254 dead terrorists, including every member of the Chelyabinsk partisan command, 133 in custody, and 13 dead League soldiers. The spine of the resistance in Chelyabinsk has been broken. Those terrorists who remain free will either submit to the inevitable or continue their doomed struggle. Without their commanders to guide their treachery it will not be long until we catch them."

Paranoia has gripped the city with rumors of partisan infiltration and disloyalty within the government spreading like wildfire. It seems everyone from the mayor to the custodian who sweeps his office is under suspicion, and there is no way of knowing who can be trusted. That is, until a month ago when a partisan commander Shadrinsk wasn't quick enough with her cyanide pill and fell into the hands of our interrogators. She held out for a remarkably long time, but everyone cracks eventually. She provided a list of names that, while not comprehensive, gave the garrison of Tyumen something real to work from.\n\nSoon a few officials from the mayor's office simply vanished without any explanation. These men did not provide any information of use, but their disappearance caused a panic among the partisans. All it took was a few days of observation to find which government employees were sweating under the pressure, then placing some tails on them to find out what they had to hide. Soon the Directorate of State Security had a list of dozens of names, and the real purge could begin.\n\nNow the terrorists are running scared. Most of their leaders have been arrested or disappeared without a trace. With the local leadership exposed, the footsoldiers are running for the hills, all their grandiose plans for an uprising now nothing more than dreams. Order has been restored to Tyumen and a major blow has been dealt to Batov's criminal organization.\n\nSurprisingly, the mayor had no involvement whatsoever."

The city was the former headquarters of the military clique that Batov belonged to, and even after it was reclaimed by the League it remained a hotspot of terrorism and sabotage. The local garrison has struggled to pacify the region around the city and recently reported there was a serious risk of being forced to abandon their positions in the face of escalating attacks if they were not reinforced. In response, a full division was ordered to the city to destroy the rebellion once and for all. Word of their impending arrival reached the city before they did, and the local rebels launched a full rebellion. By the time the division arrived the city had devolved into a war zone and the local garrison was besieged inside city hall and their fortified barracks.\n\nWith no possibility of a sudden citywide sweep that would catch the rebels off guard, the division commander adopted a new strategy. Combat squads entered the city ready to clear it house by house. Intense street fighting quickly enveloped Sverdlovsk, but the uprising had been hastily organized and began abruptly before the rebels were organized. They were no match for the disciplined forces of the Black League and by the end of the first day most of the garrison had been relieved and the city center was secure. It took several more days before the outskirts were recaptured, but by that time most of the partisans were on the run, their loyalty to their officers vanishing as soon as they realized they were losing. No sign was found of Batov, though a hidden command post that he may have stayed in was uncovered. The city suffered significant damage during the fighting, but with the rebels forced out restoring order should be an easier task than before."

He'd long since grown weary of these formalities: with every contingent that saluted him came another fifty to sixty men who weren't on duty against the Menace. Another company lost to the pointlessness of display, of an indulgence so polished it almost escaped notice.\n\nThe messenger hesitated by his ear, and Yazov started. Calming himself, he snapped: "What is it? Be quick, I'm on duty."\n\n"The daughter of Karbyshev has been found." Yazov's face froze. He whispered to his fellow general and bounded away from the procession. "Where has she been found? I must know." She was the daughter of his mentor; she was owed that much, one last kindness for the man he'd never said goodbye to. But how to tell her about her father? That he'd wandered off into the forest like an old boar looking for one last fight? Oh, his head spun so - but there was so much to do -\n\nA cold certainty began to slip into his gaze, and puzzle pieces fell together in his mind. "You didn't find her. You found her handiwork." The messenger looked away, his fists clenched white. "We have credible information she's working with Batov. A People's Popular - something."\n\nSomething died in Yazov's eyes.

In any case, there was little need to maintain extended correspondence. Most of the time the dossiers were also anonymous - why pretend these people mattered in more than purely operational capacities?\n\nNot this folder, however. This one was earmarked by Yazov himself, and in the days since he'd authorised offensive action against its subject he'd come again and again to its pages. How could he not? The dossier belonged to the daughter of his greatest influence, his second father - his enemy, and now an anonymous corpse officially buried in an anonymous grave.\n\nHe flicked open the pages, poring over the details; where had it gone wrong? Surely there had been some imagined slight, some magnified transgression that swallowed them both, broke father from child - there had to be. What had happened to them? If things had gone differently, would Karbysheva now be standing in Yazov's place, fighting for the Iron Dream of Russia born anew?\n\nAnd how best to honor a daughter who had died fighting her father's greatest dream? Yazov had never found the answer to that satisfactory. So he had come up with his own - as he grasped the pages of the dossier, he prayed that he'd done the right thing.\n\nThat night, the Government of Omsk announced a planned renewal of the Founder's Memorial, in the City Centre; repairs took a day to complete. If a coffin, with a dossier placed atop it, made its way to the Memorial, no one took notice - and if it did not emerge come the morning, when the Memorial was resealed, there was nary a peep."

Yazov had skimmed the report earlier and it seemed to contain mostly good news, though he had called Pitovranov to his office to confirm that. The economist, always a man of details, had been reading the report for almost an hour, leaving Yazov waiting for him to finish. In that time Yazov had made himself a cup of coffee, written a memo for commanders of the combat cadres, briefly contemplated cleaning his window, and made a list of captured partisans he wanted executed.\n\nPitovranov cleared his throat and put down the report, finally finished with it.

The ISD had made great strides in the pacification of the area, but there remained one more major obstacle: Marshal Batov. His photograph was pinned to the corkboard in the ISD headquarters, generously perforated with pinholes. Beneath it were arrayed various photographs of other officers from Sverdlovsk; all were dead, their eyes crossed out - but not Batov.\n\n"He's got to be somewhere in the forests, surely," said one officer, tapping the circled woods north of Sverdlovsk. "It just makes sense, doesn't it?"\n\n"He'd get lost in there just as readily as anyone else," countered his junior. "No, sir, I believe him to be in Zlatoust, possibly in the area of the capital. Hiding in plain sight works more often than you'd think, and it would give him ready access to stolen weapons."\n\nWherever the treacherous marshal was hiding, he had to be found quickly. The bandits under his command were wreaking merry havoc. Patrols went missing, bridges were blown up, supply depots raided. They knew what to do when they found him, but doing so in the first place - that was the rub. Batov was no ordinary partisan leader, but one of the finest strategists in all Russia. However, he was also still just a man - find his weakness, and he would crumble in an instant."

They'd rarely been expected to engage in combat back in the days of the Union. Most of what they'd seen was anti-partisan warfare, which this was... technically. Whereas decades ago they had faced off against indignant Polish and Baltic farmers after the annexations, now they were up against some of the best soldiers in Russia, commanded by one of the best commanders in Russia.\n\nThey had to be ready for Batov's men.

It is important that you, as officer candidates, understand that a just cause does not win wars. If this was the case, then Germany surely would have been defeated in the last war. But, instead, they won, not because of some mythical racial 'heritage,' but because their armed forces were the strongest. It is for this reason that we will not teach you ideals, but simply the observable facts upon which we base our actions. Our entire program of national salvation is founded upon a set of three tautological theses, into which we have condensed the whole of Dmitry Karbyshev's geo-strategic thought."\n\n"The first Karbyshevite thesis - the Great Trial is inevitable. It is impossible to know the true intentions of nation-states, and thus conflict between them is inevitable. And so our present tripolar arrangement is bound to collapse eventually into global conflict in the form of the Great Trial, with Russia at its geographic center."\n\n"The Second Thesis - if Russia is not prepared for the Trial, our civilization will be obliterated. To prove this, one must only look at the weapons of modern war. The next war will be total beyond any concept of totality. Eventually, nuclear weapons will be used, which, if we are not prepared to face them, will lead to our annihilation."\n\nThe instructor took a deep breath before launching into his peroration, the tone of his voice now becoming that of a fiery preacher. "And at last, the Third Thesis - the synthesis. As the only organization which has recognized this geopolitical inevitability, and the only one which is actively preparing to face it, the Black League is Russia's sole hope for survival. We will fortify our nation. And, once the guns fall silent, we will emerge from beneath the Earth to take back that which is ours, and exact our vengeance upon the Germans." "

How he had felt paralyzed, every idea bringing forth ten counterarguments and a hundred nightmare scenarios. But it wasn't this panic that brought him back to this place time and time again.\n\nIt was how he had pulled himself out of it, against his every instinct and impulse - slowly, at first, forcing himself to follow through on his own decisions, swatting away doubt and putting faith in himself.

To the south the states of the southern Urals continued to persist despite all odds, waiting to be swallowed by one of the behemoths around them. In the middle of it all was the West Siberian Provisional Authority, a bastion of order and duty surrounded by treachery.\n\nOptimism was a luxury Yazov did not afford himself, but some part of him had hoped that once western Siberia was unified the road to unification would be easy. Instead the League had been forced to grapple with rebellions and dissent. Rebuilding Russian society to be ready for the Great Trial had been time consuming, but necessary. While the Black League was working to pull its portion of Russia out of the darkness and prepare for the storm that was coming, the warlords around them had expanded their territory and consolidated their hold over vast stretches of the Motherland. Dislodging them would not be easy.\n\nYazov took solace in the strength of the League. In less than a decade it had grown from a corrupt and disorganized organization confined to a single city into a colossus ready to reunite the nation and bring justice to those who have wronged the Russian people. The armies of the League could not be stopped by even the mightiest opponents.

It would not be a joyful event. It was the League's grim responsibility to rebuild the Motherland and punish those who weakened her.

Those too bruised went to the glorified morgue of a "hospital" and few ever returned.\n\nIn the second week, as his group was on a ten-mile run, Yevgeniy spotted a carrot in the dirt. Knowing better than to run to get it, Yevgeniy tried to ignore the orange beauty that his malnourished body yearned for. With only two small meals, he wanted nothing more than to devour it. As they neared it, he caved. Breaking formation and shoving his comrade out of his way, he fell on the ground clutching the carrot. In a flurry of shouts, kicks, and strikes from a baton, Yevgeniy finally got his sleep.\n\nThe camp at Vorkuta came to be known as the Fang for its unrelenting training style and harsh management. Within a month of the first arrivals coming in, 25 had died of injuries sustained during training."

Then, in came the Glavkoverkh, as though he were a civilian wandering into a shop on a lazy Sunday.\n\n"As you were, comrades," said Yazov, his face an unreadable half-smile. Within a heartbeat, every man had resumed his previous activities, unquestioning of their leader's sudden laxity. Yazov began to stroll through the hall at a leisurely pace, looking left to right with the drill sergeant and two armed guards at his back. He paused before a group of men engaged in rapid, relentless push-ups.\n\n"How long have these men been going, sergeant?" he asked, his tone neutral.\n\n"My apologies, sir, but I've no idea. Corporal Rykov is leading them, though."\n\n"Corporal Rykov, at attention!" called Yazov. A giant of a man leapt to his feet and snapped to, stone-faced and straight-backed. "How many push-ups have you fellows performed today, Corporal?"\n\nDespite towering over Yazov, the man swallowed. "I'm not certain, sir. We measure ourselves in time rather than individual actions. Currently we stand at thirteen minutes straight."\n\nYazov tapped his chin. "Explain your reasoning for this, Corporal."\n\n"Sir!

In the afternoon, he learned about how he could better shape himself to help, with ever increasing effectiveness, the purification, reclamation, and vengeance inherent to the other programs.\n\nEvery day - one more day closer to the Great Trial - he learned more, understood more, and became more prepared.\n\nHe had even begun applying his lessons outside of school, watching carefully for evidence of revisionism or insufficient dedication. He had already identified several such individuals, and though he could of course not be sure what happened after his reports, at least two had, so far, not been seen since. And deservedly so.\n\nAndrey intended to protect himself, his family, his people, and the Black League, and he would not be deterred from any course of action that would advance any of those goals.\n\nThat was what his teachers had taught him, and Andrey very much loved school."

Foreign affairs had initially deemed it to be too dangerous, especially considering that up until now Omsk and its surrounding territory has been an informational black hole. This, more than anything, is what led to CIA pressure to attend.\n\nA few CIA agents disguised as bodyguards attended the conference with the curious diplomats last week, and reported that the situation in Omsk appeared surprisingly... normal.\n\nThe government had clearly done hasty work to beautify the city center and refurbish an old hotel for diplomatic use, but such a thing was hardly out of the ordinary when American officials visited developing nations.\n\nTruthfully, most were impressed at how well the local government had patched over the cracks of war and decay, and found it to be an excellent sign of the government's effectiveness.\n\nThe only dissenting opinion of this rather pleasant assessment was from an older agent, who insisted there was something off about the people's smiles - something dead and rotten in their eyes.\n\nRegardless of his paranoia, the conference went rather well, with diplomats being well fed with local cuisine and well watered with vodka. They were even given the honour of meeting the ever busy Dmitry Yazov, who the diplomats found to be a very impressive figure. They assure us that, while he wasn't democratically elected, he seems to be a 'developmental authoritarian', using his unchecked executive power to turn a backwards region around for the better before transitioning to democracy. The West Siberian request was hardly unexpected, they merely wished for OFN recognition of their government as a sovereign state.\n\nWe hardly have any reason not to accept."

The little Russian men had clearly gone to great effort to renovate the city center for our diplomats, but were horrendously embarrassed when a wrong turn on the way from the airport led the mission on a detour through the dirty industrial district of the city. A business expert assigned to the diplomatic team reportedly grew insatiably excited after spotting the vast reserves of Siberian resources laid out in endless stockpiles.\n\nThe concessions requested by the West Siberians were mostly minimal, the largest demand being an official recognition of them as a legitimate and sovereign nation.\n\nWhile we have no guarantee that the West Siberians will actually come out on top of the Russian conflicts, it's a very small request compared to a potentially enormous economic gain."

Wishful thinking took them far enough to think we might actually go through with the insulting plan.

While the ministry has additional ideas to entice and ensnare foreign support, we now have all we need to lull the outside world into complacency.\n\n-Diplomatic outreaches, regardless of how successful they were, have breached through the static and have established contact with the outside world. At the very least, military planners are confident that outsiders will contact us with words now, rather than bombs.\n\n-The Reich has received a statement of our intent, and their paranoia has already begun to work in favour of our plans. The militarists have spent decades searching for an enemy, and now that they've found one in us, they've begun to overplay their hand, spreading discord through their blood-soaked empire, aided by the infiltrators we've sent into their borders.\n\n-Finally, on the local scale we've ramped up our intelligence operations, and we now have sympathetic ears ready and willing to aid our armies on the field in the unification wars to come."

 omsksr.1.d:0 "Glavkoverkh Yazov, head of the Black League and savior of the Russian people, stood stoic at the podium. He looked down at his prepared remarks, and found them wanting. They were merely words on a page. He would give the world more than an announcement. He would give them a declaration.\n\n"To all the heroes of Russia assembled here today..." He started off a bit shaky, his voice a little too monotonal over the microphone.\n\n"There have been many who have told us of our imminent failure. Many who have doubted the will and strength of a people long under assault. Many who fear what we might become. They know nothing of the sacrifices the Russian people have been forced to make in the name of survival. But we know, comrades. We know all too well what was lost in the First Trial, and we know now what must be done.\n\nHe began to speed up. His clenched hand wrapped around the podium, and he leaned forward.\n\n"Russia must be made strong again, and the Russian people with it. We must do this for our own survival, and we cannot expect help from abroad. But the inner strength of our nation, of the people themselves, is a bottomless resource, and it has been tested time, and time again. We must use that now to construct a new Russia from the ashes of the old, and do whatever is necessary to ensure that it survives forevermore.\n\n"At stake is everything you know, and the survival of every man, woman, and child in Russia. For if we were to fail, and let the German reconquer what he wills, or let the weaklings around us take power, the world will never again make the mistake of letting the Russian people reunite. But we will not fail. For that, I depend- Russia depends- on your courage and skill."\n\nHe relaxed as he wound down. His hand unclenched, he stood straight, and spoke softly.\n\n"Know that each of you pushes forward the day that we all see Russia freed from its chains. Long live the Reclamation Government, and the justice that it will bring!"\n\nWith one voice, the answer came:"

A "Reclamation Government" has been formed by the Black League to reclaim Russian territory from those it deems unworthy or traitorous to the Russian people. Their successes so far have shown them to be a powerful military force\n\nLed by Dmitry Yazov, the Reclamation Government has made many promises to the Russian people, the most significant of which is a return to democracy after reunification and "strengthening" of Russia. Whether he is Cincinnatus or Caesar, Yazov certainly now has the power of a military dictator, and appears to have cemented his rule.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether this military state can last, whether Yazov can keep the reins steady.\n"

They had promised food, shelter, and community, which was two more things than any of the villagers had right now. But the little town near Samara was now part of the League, and that meant that the people in it were, too. A middle-aged man sat behind a desk as a mother and her child approached.\n\n"Only one at a time, please, ma'am."\n\n"Please, he is very young. I only wish to make sure-" The official raised his finger to cut her off.\n\n"That is for me to decide. He shall serve the League in whatever way Russia requires. What is his age?"\n\n"He is only 16. Surely there is some work he can do." She began to whisper. "Something away from the front lines."\n\nHe was not 16. The official was quite aware that he was not 16. And still, he paused for a few seconds. He recalled his own Youth Cadre, the punishments, the pain, as well as the brotherhood. This mother had no idea what being 16 in Omsk actually meant, what it required. His face grew blank as he accidentally stared at the boy. His pen hovered over the assignment card. "If he were not 16, I might be able to assign him to an industrial cadre rather than a Youth Cadre." The official looked very purposefully at the mother. "Do you understand me?"\n\nThe mother watched as his sunken face turned towards her. There was very little to indicate any change in expression, except that the corners of his lifeless eyes seemed to twitch, and there was a turn in his stubbled right cheek. "...Yes. He is 18."\n\n"I see. You are being assigned to Cadre 603481, in Luzino. Your son will be assigned to Cadre 704821, in Tomsk. Do not pack anything. You will be transported tomorrow. Say whatever goodbyes you need to. It is unlikely you will see anyone here again."\n\n"But surely he could stay with me and-"\n\n"Do not test the limits of my patience. You will find them short.""

Sealed doorways, CBRN-resistant ventilation systems, room for nearly three hundred people in this underground home. He traced his finger down the elevator and along the hallway to the residential areas. He had been in enough bunkers to know what it would look like. He knew how the walls would feel rough and unwelcoming, how the air would start to become stale, how the silence would start to drive you mad after a few weeks. The engineer's voice snapped him out of his daydream.\n\n"Current estimates are that it could survive a five megaton warhead detonating at .22 km height at any distance farther than half a kilometer. Survivors would be able to continue operations without further supply for up to half a year, at which point potable water would be expended. Our estimated cost for each is a hundred thousand rubles, depending on terrain and features. Naturally, they can be outfitted with additional modules for command units, armories, and etcetera, to be designated at time of construction."\n\nAll so technical. So deterministic.

This was to be Russia's future. This had to be Russia's future. For a second, he allowed himself to feel safe and ready. Nothing could touch them here. The network of these bunkers that had been built would secure the Russian people against any eventuality. These small rooms, barely large enough for three stacked cots and shelves, were a great accomplishment of the program of national action: survival of the Russian nation, whatever the cost. He had always spoken about it in words, and always believed it, but the bunkers were his words made manifest.\n\nThe lights flickered off for a moment. When they came back on, Yazov had already started back up the stairs towards the elevator. There was still so much to be done. Tons of concrete and snaking tunnels do not prepare a nation for war. He didn't even know if the bunkers would work, yet he had claimed to all assembled that their security was guaranteed forevermore. He climbed faster. What a joke he had played on all of them, and on himself, in thinking that he could stop the inevitable. He was nothing, just the shadow of Karbyshev, a pretender playing the savior for all to see.\n\nHe arrived at the elevator, adjusted his cap, and pushed the button.

I would like to talk with you a moment about a brief collaborative project that, I think, would benefit both of our countries. I have invited some gentlemen from Hollywood that have expressed interest in this endeavor and have written a brief script that reflects the ideas we would like to see put onto the big screen.\n\n"To put it simply, Ambassador, we want to show that our objective is neither some vengeful crusade, nor to establish some brutal dictatorship-quite the opposite! What we want is what any nation wishes for- peace and security for its citizens. Our circumstances require some regimentation, yes, but discipline is not such a terrible thing if citizens themselves take pride in defending their homeland."\n\nAfter a brief look through the screenplay which contained many "sweeping shots of hardy workers enjoying their labor", the ambassador grimaced and scratched his chin."

"The work being done to improve living conditions everywhere in Siberia, your industrial innovations, your use of natural resources- I am greatly impressed by what I have seen here. I believe history will record you as a great builder for the benefit of mankind," he replied.\n\nWith a final handshake, and the ambassador turning back for a final salute as he walked out the door, the famous movie, "Mission to Omsk", portraying the purported reality of life in newly unified West Siberia, faded to black. Reviews have been highly polarized, with some saying that it is merely a propagandistic hack job, while others credit innovative screenplay design and the use of helicopters to capture scenes of expansive Russia as never seen before.

Just a few days ago, he had been transmitting data about the local garrison from his airdropped comms unit. Whether there was a rat in the town or whether his transmissions had been intercepted was irrelevant at this point. What mattered was that he was screwed.\n\nIt was there, in the muck, that he decided that he would die here. He knew what the Germans would do to him if they captured him- the manuals he had been given told one story, but his comrades in the unit told of far worse fates that awaited him. But he would choose to die on his own soil, his nation's soil. And one day, there would be tanks running through this swamp, throwing these arrogant Germans off the ground that he would make sacred.\n\nHe looked at the small pill he had been given in case of emergencies.

While conventional military action will be needed to dismantle the German state, it will also be necessary to use unconventional means to assist this main objective. With that in mind, specialized units will be deployed into the heart of Germany well before military operations commence in order to sabotage infrastructure, cause civilian casualties, and destroy the trust of the government in its military.\n\n"Probing attacks must first be conducted in vulnerable areas on insignificant targets- namely, isolated civilians and low-ranking officials. Utilizing information gained here on German reactions, we can target our larger-scale operations towards infrastructure and transport systems. Critical to these attacks will be the usage of German chemical weapons- this will result in suspicion being directed towards the Wehrmact. We can then escalate attacks towards the population, resulting in the desired split between the civilian and military leadership. Research into replicating these agents is, therefore, of a high priority.\n\n"With the civilian government fearing a coup from within and the military attempting to maintain order, we expect that we will be able to trigger a partial shutdown of the strategic command structure within the timespan of one to two months after major operations begin. This will severely hamper any conventional or nuclear response to our initial attacks. You may find an extended timeline on pages twenty-five through twenty-eight, and a requested budget on pages thirty-three through thirty-nine.""

Over the long, awkward pause, Yazov grew anxious. Was he going to have to jail them? Shoot them? These men, who had fought for the nation so admirably?\n\nThe two men opposite exchanged a few mumbled comments. Ustinov snorted. Yepishev looked concerned. After what felt like minutes, with Yazov growing more and more impatient, they finally stood. First Ustinov, then Yepishev, then Yazov.\n\n"Comrade, we would be proud to serve under your leadership. Let us help the Black League to restore the full glory of Russia." The two men snapped to salute.\n\nYazov returned the salute.

Well, a genuine nuclear reaction is not necessary for such an event. Merely spreading radioactive fallout is good enough.

A conventional bomb would not spread the radiation nearly as far as a nuclear bomb, would it not?"\n\n"You are correct, Glavkomverh. Even our largest conventional weapons would not have the truly desired effect. However, there are a couple advantages to these 'dirty' bombs. One, they are easier to make. We can therefore have more available to target more cities in the Trial. Two, they can be made smaller than real nuclear devices. Small enough, perhaps, to be carried by a dedicated agent into a population center. This would make upcoming operations far more effective.\n\n"Furthermore, the effect of radiation may not be significant past a few kilometers – but the people of Germany will not know that, nor will they believe their government when they tell them so.

His host continued his narration. There were several cells, for instance, for the testing of a hemorrhagic smallpox strain, codenamed "India," obtained from an anonymous seller. His team had been slowly breeding the virus to be resistant to almost every antibiotic available in Russia. Upon mentioning this fact, Ovchinnikov had turned to Yazov and, like a schoolboy telling a prurient joke to a friend, had suggested with a smirk that the medical aid being sought abroad by the Glavkoverkh might come in handy for this. Then, he directed Yazov's attention to a darkened room at the end of the hall, turning on the light to reveal a nearly skeletal man, hunched over an exercise bike of some kind. This man, as the major explained, was being used to test the efficacy of pathogens on soldiers in combat. Having been infected, lengthy stints on the bike simulated physical strain, while the psychological stress was replicated by firing live rounds over his head at random intervals.

The men were dead now, but he couldn't kill their words, words eating away at his mind like a corrosive poison. He had to know.\nAnother day. Karbyshev's old Tatar aide, caught in Tyumen, regarding the Glavkoverkh with pity even as he languished in his manacles. Yazov remembered how he had stood up, ramrod-straight, staring down at the prostrate yet defiant man from mere feet away. And how that man had nonchalantly told him how it was all true. He wanted to go out on his own terms, the Tatar had said. He decided to embrace the inevitable. He had taken control, the Tatar had added, mocking Yazov. Again, the man was now gone. But, even without their vessel, the accursed words still fluttered about, haunting him. Confidence was now draining away, being replaced by a growing shame that he was letting this hound him at all. The Great Trial awaited, he told himself. He had greater things to deal with, a greater mark to leave on history. The inevitable-\nYazov's mind crystallized into absolute clarity. The conclusion was simple, the logic plain. Just as Karbyshev had seen the inevitability of death, and thus embraced it on his own terms, so should Russia not simply wait for the Great Trial, but start it when she was ready. He saw his path forward, his decisive mark in history. The warm winds of destiny were at his back, overriding his own doubts, as he looked up to the plaque on the wall bearing the three Karbyshevite theses. Now, there would be a fourth."

 omsksr.24.d:0 "Valery and Alek watched as the rusted metal gates of the Black Mountain turn inwards, its hinges howling the whole way down. Dressed in hazmat suits and gas masks, their breathing seemed to echo in the walls of this place. It was dark, with only their electric lights piercing the gloom. They looked at the walls, the moss that had grown over the concrete, like greenish plaque on an infected tooth. A transparent film formed over it, a liquid that seeped through years of non-maintenance. Drip, drip, drip. The ceilings seemed to perspire in fear of what it had contained.\n\n"Alek," Valery said, "I get the feeling that this place ain't friendly." Friendly, frien, frie, fri. His voice echoed within the vast chambers of the Mountain's research complex. "Did you hear that?"\n\n"I did." Alek seemed more amazed than afraid of this place, although Valery saw his left arm tremble. The fingers that held the flashlight were a little unsteady. "I've heard stories. My family lived in Sverdlovsk. People who go here," Alek said, his flashlight drifting towards the ceiling, "do not come back. Either researcher or subject."\n\n"That infamous, huh."\n\n"You're from Zlatoust. You wouldn't know."\n\n"I guess." They walked inside, the concrete crunching under the heels of their boots. "Did you smell that? Is that rotten mea-"\n\nAlek cut him off. "Better if you don't describe it at all. Far better.""

 omsksr.26.d:0 ""N-Neyn! Please!"\n\n"Your use of the disgusting Germanic tongue disgusts me, whelp. We have razed your hideouts, slaughtered your fellow pretenders, obliterated your divisions, and you have the audacity to speak in a language which threatens the Russian state?"\n\nWithout a single chance to respond, the member of an Aryan Brotherhood combat unit was swiftly executed with a pistol shot, falling forward into a shallow dirt hole. He was one of many on his knees, blindfolded, in a line facing a makeshift mass grave dug swiftly after the aftermath of the final battle against the appearers. Cadre 227719 was assigned to liquidation of several units of men who had surrendered against the might of the Russian Reclamation Government. Upon orders from Yazov himself, no mercy was to be shown. Any single man who held a rifle in their treasonous act of Teutonic appeasement was to have their life taken.\n\nCries were heard from some of the men. Others breathed heavily while awaiting their imminent fate. A member of the Cadre stepped behind another traitor on the ground, with the blindfolded soldier sniffing rapidly.\n\nThe roaring fire of artillery in the distance masked another shot, and with it the brass expelled from falling to the ground below. Another thud, another traitor to the motherland deep in his grave.\n\nThis was not the last of this scene, and many like this were happening across the former territories of the Aryan Brotherhood. Justice has finally been served in the Russian Anarchy, and every pretender in the grave would prepare Russia more and more for her upcoming Great Trial."
